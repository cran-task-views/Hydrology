This Task View contains information about packages broadly relevant to *hydrology*, defined as the movement, distribution and quality of water and water resources over a broad spatial scale of landscapes. Packages are broadly grouped according to their function; however, many have functionality that spans multiple categories. We also highlight other, existing resources that have related functions - for example, statistical analysis or spatial data processing. See also [Riccardo Rigon's excellent list](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2012/08/r-resources-for-hydrologists.html) of hydrology-related R tools and resources.

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this Task View, go to GitHub and [submit an issue](https://github.com/ropensci/Hydrology/issues), or make some changes and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ropensci/Hydrology/pulls). If you can't contribute on GitHub, [send Sam Zipper an email](mailto:samzipper@ku.edu). If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that package.
