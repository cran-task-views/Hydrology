*hydrology* , defined as the movement, distribution and quality of water
and water resources over a broad spatial scale of landscapes. Packages
are broadly grouped according to their function; however, many have
functionality that spans multiple categories. We also highlight other,
existing resources that have related functions - for example,
statistical analysis or spatial data processing. See also

    [Koutsoyiannis et al., 1998, [doi:10.1016/S0022-1694(98)00097-3](doi:10.1016/S0022-1694(98)00097-3)].

    loss, flow or diameter, plotting a Moody diagram, matching a pump
    characteristic curve to a system curve, and solving for flows in
    a pipe network using the Hardy-Cross method. The Darcy-Weisbach
    friction factor is calculated using the Colebrook (or

    [doi:10.1680/ijoti.1939.13150](doi:10.1680/ijoti.1939.13150). For
    gravity flow, the Manning equation is used, again solving for
    missing parameters. The derivation of and solutions using the
    Darcy-Weisbach equation and the Manning equation are outlined in
    many fluid mechanics texts such as Finnemore and Franzini (2002,
    ISBN:978-0072432022). For the Manning equation solutions, this
    package uses modifications of original code from the 'iemisc'
    package by Irucka Embry.

-  `r pkg("PowerSDI")`: The PowerSDI calculates two Standardised Drought Indices (SPI and SPEI) 
    using NASA POWER Data. The package also verifies if the indices' estimates meet 
    the assumption of normality and how well NASA POWER estimates represent real-world 
    data. Indices are calculated in a routine mode. Potential evapotranspiration amounts 
    and the difference between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are also calculated.
    It adopts a basic time scale that splits each month into four periods where 'TS=4' 
    corresponds to a 1-month length moving window (calculated 4 times per month) and 
    'TS=48' corresponds to a 12-month length moving window (calculated 4 times per month).`

-   `r pkg("IETD")`: Computes characteristics of independent rainfall
    events (duration, total rainfall depth, and intensity) extracted
    from a sub-daily rainfall time series based on the inter-event
    time definition (IETD) method. To have a reference value of IETD,
    it also analyzes/computes IETD values through three methods:
    autocorrelation analysis, the average annual number of events
    analysis, and coefficient of variation analysis. Ideal for
    analyzing the sensitivity of IETD to characteristics of
    independent rainfall events. Adams B, Papa F (2000)
