 <p>This Task View contains information about packages broadly relevant to <em>hydrology</em>, defined as the movement, distribution and quality of water and water resources over a broad spatial scale of landscapes. Packages are broadly grouped according to their function; however, many have functionality that spans multiple categories. We also highlight other, existing resources that have related functions - for example, statistical analysis or spatial data processing. See also <a href="https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2012/08/r-resources-for-hydrologists.html">Riccardo Rigon’s excellent list</a> of hydrology-related R tools and resources.</p>
<p>If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this Task View, go to GitHub and <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/hydrology/issues">submit an issue</a>, or make some changes and <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/hydrology/pulls">submit a pull request</a>. If you can’t contribute on GitHub, <a href="mailto:samuelczipper@gmail.com">send Sam Zipper an email</a>. If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that package.</p>
