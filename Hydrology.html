        This Task View contains information about packages broadly relevant to
        <em>
          hydrology
        </em>, defined as the movement, distribution and quality of water and water resources over a broad spatial scale of landscapes. Packages are broadly grouped according to their function; however, many have functionality that spans multiple categories. We also highlight other, existing resources that have related functions - for example, statistical analysis or spatial data processing. See also
        <a href="https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2012/08/r-resources-for-hydrologists.html">

        of hydrology-related R tools and resources.
